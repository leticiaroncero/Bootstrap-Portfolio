                    I'm a Community Manager living in San Francisco, California. I have a degree in Journalism from the
                    Complutense University of Madrid (UCM), Spain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer currently enrolled at the Coding Bootcamp at UC
                    Berkeley
                    Extension.
                    I chose this new career because I have a passion for all things creative and like to build things
                    and
                    invent solutions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I moved out to San Francisco in January of 2014 to complete a Certificate Program in Marketing and
                    take
                    a position with Flickr, as part of their Community Team. This was a great opportunity to interact
                    with a
                    vast audience, and partner with our product, marketing, support, and engineering teams to identify
                    and
                    test ways of cultivating community on Flickr.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My goal is to become a developer, build my own projects, and understand and communicate better with
                    other developers in today's ever-changing working environment.
